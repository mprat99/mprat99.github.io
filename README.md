# 🚀 Marc's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This is a work-in-progress playground where I'm learning frontend development and React by building something visually exciting and technically rich—with a little help from AI along the way.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** – The core of the app, powering dynamic components and interactivity.
- **Vite** – Lightning-fast build tool for a smooth development experience.
- **GSAP** – For slick animations that bring the UI to life.
- **Lenis** – Smooth scrolling to elevate the user experience.
- **Three.js (coming soon)** – Planning to integrate 3D elements for extra visual flair.

## 🎯 Goals

This portfolio isn't just a showcase—it's a creative lab. I'm aiming to:

- Highlight my projects with **videos**, **images**, and **interactive previews**
- Build custom **components** that reflect my style and skills
- Experiment with **3D visuals**, **scroll effects**, and **micro-interactions**
- Learn and apply modern frontend techniques in real time

## 📦 Features So Far

- Basic layout and routing with React
- Initial GSAP animations and Lenis scroll setup
- Component structure for future project sections
- AI-assisted coding and design decisions

## 📚 Learning Journey

I'm teaching myself frontend development and React by building this portfolio from scratch. Every commit is a step forward—whether it's fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or experimenting with design.
